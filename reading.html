			<p>
				Everyone has a collection of blog posts and books that have helped them with a specific problem area or changed how they think about the world.<br>
				Below are the books and blog posts I have found really helped my thinking on businesses, working culture, and how to do it right.<br>
				My goal is for this list to be challenged and change over time, that's why I run a non-fiction book club with some friends in London. If you want to join us just email me.<br>

				<h1>Books</h1>
				<h2>The Second Machine Age</h2>
				<p>
				<a href="img/second_machine-age-cover" rel="lightbox" class="col-2"><img src="img/second_machine-age-cover" alt="Second Machine Age"></a>
				The way we think about GDP in a digital age is wrong and discussed how AI would impact jobs back in 2014.
				My most common example from the book is how as consumers it takes a generational shift to realise the full potential of new technology, in the intermediate step we continue our old practices but slightly more efficiently. 
				</p>
				<h2>Not For Bread Alone</h2>
				<p>
				<a href="img/not-for-bread-alone.jpg" rel="lightbox" class="col-2"><img src="img/not-for-bread-alone.jpg" alt="Not For Bread Alone"></a>
				I was inspired to read this book by Konosuke Matsushita, the founder Panasonic and a "god of management" after <a href="https://medium.com/@ystrickler/resist-and-thrive-1d36819853ca">Yancey Strickler's talk at Web Summit 2015</a>. 
				
				</p>
				<h2>My Life & Work</h2>
				<p>
				<a href="img/second_machine-age-cover" rel="lightbox" class="col-2"><img src="img/second_machine-age-cover" alt="Second Machine Age"></a>
				Henry Ford did a lot wrong in his life and I've found it hard to align the value I've got from his business thinking with my rejection of a lot of the actions to took in his life.
				However there are some lessons I took from his autobiography;
				<li>I was encouraged that he thought about MVPS long before the software boom:<br>
				<i>"Start with an article that suits and then study to find some way of eliminating the entirely useless parts. This applies to everything--a shoe, a dress, a house, a piece of machinery, a railroad, a steamship, an airplane. As we cut out useless parts and simplify necessary ones we also cut down the cost of making."</i> </li>
				<li>And by his thoughts on chasing money vs doing good work:<br>
				<i>"if you give attention to work and service, the resources will increase more rapidly than you can devise ways and means of disposing of them."</i> </li>
				</p>
				<h2>Start With No</h2>
				<p>
				<a href="img/start-with-no" rel="lightbox" class="col-2"><img src="img/start-with-no" alt="Start With No"></a>
				I picked this book up when I started negotiating bigger long terms deals for Songkick and found the process not only great for my immediate task of negotiating deals with <a href="http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2017/03/songkick-announces-shazam-integration-new-stats.html">Shazam</a> and <a href="http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2016/11/pandora-gets-a-makeover-replays-more-skips-and-tour-dates-via-ticketfly-and-songkick.html">Pandora</a> it also contains models for approaching problems that are generalisable for issues that come up in product development.<br>
				<i>Bad decisions are not the thing that kills you, it's not making a decision. If you make a wrong decision then your job is to learn from it, make another decision and move forwards.</i>

				<h3><a href="http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html">Paul Graham: Wealth</a>
				<p>
				<i>“There are a lot of ways to get rich, and this essay is about only one of them. This essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and getting paid for it. There are plenty of other ways to get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly, graft, lobbying, counterfeiting, and prospecting. Most of the greatest fortunes have probably involved several of these.”</i>

				<p>
				<i>“No matter what excuses are made or exceptions declared, it’s the rule that companies at one time viewed as clear winners will ultimately experience the threat of decline and extinction at the end of the Arc of Life. No organization is immune to this fate. Only a select few have demonstrated their ability to undertake enough transformative shifts to extend their life decades beyond their competition.”</i>
