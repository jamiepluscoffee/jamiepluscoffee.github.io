				Everyone has a collection of blog posts and books that helped with a specific problem area or changed how they think about the world.<br>
				<br>
				Below are the books and blog posts I have found really helped my thinking on businesses, culture, and how to do it right.<br>
				<br>
				My goal is for this list to be challenged and change over time, that's why I run a non-fiction book club with some friends in London. If you want to join us just <a href="mailto:hijameshughes@gmail.com">email me</a>.<br>

				<h2>The Second Machine Age</h2>
				<a href="img/second_machine_age_cover.jpg" rel="lightbox" class="col-3"><img src="img/second_machine_age_cover.jpg" alt="Second Machine Age"></a>
				<p>The way we think about GDP in a digital age is wrong and discussed how AI would impact jobs back in 2014.
				My most common example from the book is how as consumers it takes a generational shift to realise the full potential of new technology, in the intermediate step we continue our old practices but slightly more efficiently. 
				</p>
				<h2>Not For Bread Alone</h2>
				<a href="img/not-for-bread-alone.jpg" rel="lightbox" class="col-3"><img src="img/not-for-bread-alone.jpg" alt="Not For Bread Alone"></a>
				<p>
				I was inspired to read this book by Konosuke Matsushita, the founder Panasonic and a "god of management" after <a href="https://medium.com/@ystrickler/resist-and-thrive-1d36819853ca">Yancey Strickler's talk at Web Summit 2015</a>. 
				</p>
				<h2>My Life & Work</h2>
				<a href="img/second_machine_age_cover.jpg" rel="lightbox" class="col-2"><img src="img/second_machine_age_cover.jpg" alt="Second Machine Age"></a>
				<p>
				Henry Ford did a lot wrong in his life and I've found it hard to align the value I've got from his business thinking with my rejection of a lot of the actions to took in his life.
				However there are some lessons I took from his autobiography:<br>
				He thought about MVPs long before the software boom - <br>
				<i>"Start with an article that suits and then study to find some way of eliminating the entirely useless parts. This applies to everything--a shoe, a dress, a house, a piece of machinery, a railroad, a steamship, an airplane. As we cut out useless parts and simplify necessary ones we also cut down the cost of making."</i> </li>
				And by his thoughts on chasing money vs doing good work - <br>
				"If you give attention to work and service, the resources will increase more rapidly than you can devise ways and means of disposing of them."</i>
				</p>
				<h2>Start With No</h2>
				<a href="img/start-with-no.jpeg" rel="lightbox" class="col-2"><img src="img/start-with-no.jpeg" alt="Start With No"></a>
				<p>
				I picked this book up when I took over responsibility for Songkick's Product Partnerships from our CEO. It helped with my immediate task of closing deals with the likes of <a href="http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2017/03/songkick-announces-shazam-integration-new-stats.html">Shazam</a> and <a href="http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2016/11/pandora-gets-a-makeover-replays-more-skips-and-tour-dates-via-ticketfly-and-songkick.html">Pandora</a> and also provided more generalisable models for approaching processes like product development.<br>
