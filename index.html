			<h1>My Work</h1>
			<div class="col-full">
				<h2>Songkick</h2>
				<p>
				I began working in startups as an intern for Songkick's community support team. I loved the team and worked my ass off and was rewarded with the offer of a full time role. Over the next four and a half years I worked on or was responsible for a number of projects including:</p>
				<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22552747">Launching Songkick Detour</a>, a crowdfunding platform for concerts.<br></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/21/songkick-iphone-in-app-ticketing">Introducing Songkick's primary ticketing</a> and scaling it to over 30% of concerts in the UK.<br></li>
				<li>Product partnership deals with the likes of <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3004531/streaming-media/spotify-launches-personalized-concert-recommendations.html">Spotify</a>, <a href="http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2017/03/songkick-announces-shazam-integration-new-stats.html">Shazam</a> and <a href="http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2016/11/pandora-gets-a-makeover-replays-more-skips-and-tour-dates-via-ticketfly-and-songkick.html">Pandora</a>.</li>
				<li>Running a hack-day <a href="https://blog.songkick.com/sketching-at-scale-f08a529ae0b">for the whole 140 person company</a>, (including all non-technical staff).</li><br>
				<p>Between all of that (and spending a fair amount of time on planes) I learned everything I could about product, growth, sales and getting shit done. I then made the hard decision to leave Songkick and try building my own startup.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Awne</h2>
				<p> With Awne we set out to investigate and solve a problem in relationship health. We asked the question 'Why, in a world where there are 1000â€™s of dating apps, is there nothing to help keep relationships healthy?'<br>
				While tackling this problem I got to:
				<li> List all our assumptions and how we could validate/invalidate them.</li> 
				<li> Source, run and synthesise user interviews.</li>
				<li> Design build and test wireframes, mockups and (eventually) a concierge MVP.</li>
				<li> Bring on board some of the leading bodies for couple therapy in the UK & US.</li>
				<li> Build a product roadmap that took us from 'skateboard' to 'race car' with room for learning and iteration.</li>
				<li> Grow a waitlist of early users through paid ads and referrals.</li>
				<li> Find and pitch some of the leading Angels in the UK/EU startup scene.</li>
				<li> Find and work with a badass team.</li>
				<li> Find out how many days in a row you can eat cous cous.</li>
				<br>
				<p>We went from a bunch of hypothesis on a whiteboard to an early product out in the wild. It was a great experience and I learned a lot but unfortunately we didn't see the results we needed to continue. (#failfast)</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Now</h2>
				<p> Having earned my first founder scars I'm currently freelancing as a product lead. I help companies make sure the product they're building is achievable and focused on the user problem.</p>
